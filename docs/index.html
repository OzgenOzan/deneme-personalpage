My background in academic research equips me with a scholarly perspective, thereby amplifying the credibility and impact of the projects. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills.</p><p>I graduated from Istanbul Medipol University Faculty of Pharmacy. 9 months of mandatory internship were included in the University's education program (throughout 5 years). I have worked 3 months in a university hospital as a clinical pharmacist, 5 months in retail pharmacies and a month in the marketing department of a pharmaceutical company. I took part as the 2nd term delegate of the Istanbul Chamber of Pharmacists Youth Council, and after graduation, I continued to contribute to the Assistant Pharmacists & Youth Council commissions.</p><p>I am currently working as a clinical research specialist. In my role, I oversee the coordination of preclinical, clinical, and bioequivalence studies, ensuring strict compliance with research and development timelines and product launches. I author expert reports and manage preclinical/clinical CTD modules for projects across over 50 countries. Additionally, I manage responses to queries and deficiencies from domestic and international regulatory bodies.</p><p>I am currently studying for my PhD in Gene and Cell Therapy, and focused on bioinformatics to specialize in data science and programming languages.</p><p>Examples are listed below for your review and a better understanding.
